# aowli — release binaries

Prebuilt distribution of the **aowli** interpreter: it runs a nimony program's
typed, semantically-analysed NIF (`.s.nif`) — the form emitted after `nimsem`.
**Binary only** — the source lives in the private `aoughwl/aowli` repo.

This repo is **public**: anyone may download and use these binaries.

## v0.2.2 — faster interpreter (full perf pass)

**v0.2.2** carries the complete interpreter performance pass on top of
v0.2.1's stdin-hang fix: ~2.2x faster tight loops and ~1.2-1.5x on
arithmetic/branch/call-heavy code (the tree-walker that backs `aowli-dbg`),
from killing per-iteration allocations and per-node string work.

**v0.2.1 fixes a startup hang:** aowli-interp and aowli-dbg no longer block
when launched with an open stdin pipe (e.g. under the aowlcode MCP debug/trace
tools or an editor/CI harness) — stdin is now read lazily, only when the program
actually reads it. Also lands interpreter performance work (~2x on loop-heavy
code; the tree-walker that backs `aowli-dbg`).

This release ships the **runtime-complete** aowli. All six runtime layers are now
implemented, so programs that exercise real memory, the OS, finalization, dynamic
dispatch, concurrency, and parallelism run — no longer just the pure-value subset:

| layer | what landed |
|-------|-------------|
| **flat memory** | a real flat byte heap under the value model — `cast`, `ptr`/`UncheckedArray`, `copyMem`/`equalMem`, pointer arithmetic write through actual bytes |
| **OS / fd** | genuine file descriptors and syscalls — `readFile`/`writeFile` are byte-exact, argv/env, stdio on real fds |
| **finalization + refcount** | ARC-style reference counting with destructors/finalizers firing at scope exit; custom `=destroy` hooks run |
| **loud dispatch** | method/dispatch on nil or an unimplemented shape is a **hard error**, never a silent no-op — the old silent-nil-dispatch class is gone |
| **async** | the cooperative Future/await dispatcher runs; combinators and `{.async.}` sugar execute |
| **threads** | a cooperative thread pool with `parfor` (`||` fork-join) |

Corpus parity (differential vs the nimony compiler as reference):
**tree-walker 432/469 = 92%**, **358 programs PASS-BOTH** engines, **zero
in-scope silent failures**.

## Binaries

| binary | what it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `aowli-interp` | run a program; `--trace` prints the call-tree, `--trace-depth:N` bounds it, `--trace-profile` gives per-routine call counts |
| `aowli-dbg`    | batch breakpoints: `--break:LINE` / `--break-func:NAME`, dumps each frame's locals at every hit (bounded render; caps at 20k hits) |

## Run

```sh
chmod +x bin/aowli-interp bin/aowli-dbg
./bin/aowli-interp <module.s.nif>              # run the program
./bin/aowli-interp --trace-profile <m.s.nif>   # per-routine call counts (wide programs)
./bin/aowli-dbg  --break:29 <module.s.nif>     # break at line 29, dump frame vars
```

## Build & hardening

Built from the private source via the `aowl-release` pipeline:

- **IR control-flow obfuscation (obfnif)** — behaviour-preserving dead-guards, junk discards, and opaque predicates woven into the typed NIF before the backend runs, so the shipped machine code carries un-elided decoy control flow (symbol rename left off; program output is unchanged)
- **string-encrypted 7-day expiry gate** — a fail-closed licence check runs at module-init and again at exit; the refusal message is stored XOR-obfuscated and decrypted into a stack buffer only when it fires, so it never appears in `strings`. The check is dispersed across three sites and output-coupled (an accumulator the exit path verifies), so patching one branch corrupts behaviour rather than cleanly bypassing.
- **anti-debug** — non-invasive `/proc/self/status` TracerPid check; a traced process refuses. Undebugged runs are unaffected.
- **hardened strip** — `strip --strip-all` (symbol table) plus `objcopy` removal of `.comment`, `.note.*`, and `.gnu_debuglink` (compiler/build-id provenance).

Verified before publishing: byte-identical program output vs the source build
across the corpus, and the stripped binaries expose **no aowli source paths, no
internal proc/type names, and no gate strings**.
